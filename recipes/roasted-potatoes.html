<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These spicy roasted potatoes made with chili powder and other seasonings are a slight variation to standard home fries. I make these spicy spuds for breakfast every Sunday, and my family loves them!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>5 medium red potatoes, diced with peel</li>
  <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
  <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
  <li>Evenly distribute potatoes and onions in the prepared baking dish. Season with garlic powder, kosher salt, and chili powder. Drizzle with olive oil and stir until well coated.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, until potatoes are fork-tender and slightly crispy, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle Cheddar cheese over top. Let sit until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.</li>
</ol>
